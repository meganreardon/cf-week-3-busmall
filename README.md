# Code Fellows, Week 3 project: Busmall

As a Marketing Research Team I:
- Would like a reachable database of how many times an image is clicked to determine it's popularity.
- Would like to be able to compare that image against all the others in the catalog.
- Would like to be able to balance those clicks with how many times each image as been displayed.

As a Focus Group Participant I:
- Would like to have a page presented that loads quickly.
- Would like my click to count immediately.
- Would like to know when I have clicked 25 images.
- Would like to see the choices I've made both now and in the past.
- Would like for nothing to happen if I accidentally click outside the image.

As a Developer I:
- Would like to use my newly acquired, if still shaky, power of buiding an object constructor to control and create an images array.
- Would like to use my newly acquired, if still shaky, power of adding an event handler to the page.
- Will use efficient code to get the number of clicks and add them to the object ____ in question.
- Will be able to quickly access my arrays to display the result of the data to the user and the marketing team.
